 #Create a variable called "age" and assign it the value 25. Print the value of the variable.
'''age= 25
This=str("Age=")
print(f'{This} {age}')'''
# What is the difference between an integer and a floating-point number in Python? Provide an example for each. 
'''Integer: This is just a whole number. eg 4,88,9090,etc.\n In python we use the int() function to access whole numbers.'''
'''floating-point numbers:these are numbers with decimal points. eg 3.4, 35.7777,etc.\nTo be able to use floating-point numbers in python we use the float() function.'''
# Write a Python program that adds two numbers together and prints the result.  
'''basic= 3 + 4
print(basic)'''
# Write a Python program that takes a number as input and multiplies it by 10. Print the result. 
'''a=int(input("number:"))
mult= a*10
print(mult)'''
#Create a list of numbers from 1 to 10. Print each number in the list using a loop. 

#Write a Python program that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the sum of all the numbers in the list. 
'''okay=[23, 18,25,17,40]
print(sum(okay[0:5]))'''
# Write a Python function that takes two numbers as input and returns their sum. 
'''def func(a,b):
    a=4
    b=5
    sum= a + b
func(4,5)'''

#Write a Python function that takes a list of numbers as input and returns the average of all the numbers in the list
# Explain the following terms relating to Python programming Language with examples where needed 
# a) Escape Sequence 
'''escape sequence(\): this can be used to execute certain actions in python coding; eg the (\n) can be used to create to enter(goes to the next line) when you run your code  '''
# b) Keywords
'''keyword: are words in programming that have assigned functions.''' 
# c) Datatypes
'''datatypes: we have three major datatypes  string, float and integer. they all have different modes of execution.
the string datatype only works with words and must be put in quotes("")
the float datatype only works with numbers with decimal point(6.9)
the integer datatype works with whole numbers(4)'''
#  d) Dictionary
'''dictionary are set of variables that consist of keys and values. dictionary can be changed/edited.'''
#  e) Module
'''modules can be defined as ''' 
# f) Interpreter 
'''interpreters can be explained as a part of the computer system that helps to translate high level languages to low level languages.
high level languages are word/english-like languages that we humans understand
low level languages are just binary numbers(1,0)'''
# Install and Import the "math" module and use its "sqrt" function to calculate the square root of a number.
'''import math as mt
work= 70
ans= mt.sqrt(work)
print(ans)'''
# Install and Import the "random" module and use its "randint" function to generate a random number between 1 and 10. 
'''import random as ran
ques= ran.randint(1,10)
print(ques)'''
# Install and Import the "pywhatkit" module and use its "whatsapp" function to send a DM to your tutor with the body “Good Day Sir” 
'''import pywhatkit as pwk
pwk.sendwhatmsg("+2349023459712",'Good day sir',5,5,5,True)'''
#Give a brief history of python, who built it, what led to Python and others
'''python was created by Guido van rosso.
Initially, the python project was called the ABC language because the students that started it wanted to create a language that anybody could understand.
They couldn't do it on their own so they went to their senior, Guido for help.
Along the line the students gave up and moved on with their lives but guido was so interested in it that he never relented.
The name "python" was gotten from a 1970's bbc comedy show that he enjoyed watching.
Python was first launched in december in the year 1989
and the version 0.9 was launched in 1990 before version 1 was launched in 1991.'''
#Give a feedback on this Python course, your instructor and this examination. 
'''It has been a priviledge learning python programming language as it is part of my major basic courses. 
Mr Habeeblah is actually a good teacher as well. He explains till you understand and he also gives you space to fully grasp all he has taught.
The examination in my opinion stands as another mode of learning because with this i have most of the questions and the answers i gave stuck in my head.'''
